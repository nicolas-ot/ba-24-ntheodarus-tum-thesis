# thesis-template
A Latex Template for your bachelor / master thesis

Please note: This is only a template. You have to adapt the template to your thesis and discuss the structure of your thesis with your supervisor.

Ideally, the template itself does not have to be adjusted. This leaves three places, that need editing:
* the .tex-files in chapters shall contain the actual content of the thesis.
* the .tex-files in resources shall contain meta-information about the thesis.
* sources from literature shall be added to the thesis.bib file.
