\chapter{Related Work}

\textit{Note: Describe related work regarding your topic and emphasize your (scientific) contribution in \textbf{contrast} to existing approaches / concepts / workflows. Related work is usually current research by others and you defend yourself against the statement: ``Why is your thesis relevant? The problem was already solved by XYZ.'' If you have multiple related works, use subsections to separate them.}
