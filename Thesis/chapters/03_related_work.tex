Similar research has been done in the work of Kapsecker et al \cite{kapsecker2022}. 
In this research, data of typing behaviors are also accumulated, such as typing speed and variation in character usage. 
Kapseckerâ€™s research, however, used a modified version of the iOS default keyboard to able to gather these data. 
This modified version of the iOS keyboard brings forwards a limitation in this research, specifically that it
shows deviation from the standard keyboard which cause more frequent use of backspace due to typos
and different typing behaviors in general. It is because the default keyboard of iOS devices is highly
optimized. Differences in structure and layout from this default keyboard, however minor, could cause
noticeable changes in the behavior of the users and thus the gathered data
